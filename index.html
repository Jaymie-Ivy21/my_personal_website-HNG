                <h1>My Goals</h1>
                <h4>This is my tech goals for the next 2 years </h4>
                <p>I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive positive social change and bridge digital divides, <br>
                    ensuring that technological advancements benefit all members of society. <br>
                    By focusing on user-friendly and accessible frontend solutions, I hope to make essential services and information <br>
                    more accessible to those who need them the most.

                    I aim to contribute to the public sector by creating technological solutions <br>
                    that support data-driven decision-making, 
                    streamline operations, and amplify the voices of marginalized communities
                </p>
                <p>In the next two years, I aim to achieve some significant goals in my tech career through a multifaceted approach.
                    <br>
                    Firstly, I plan to master two new frontend frameworks or libraries, such as ReactJS and Svelte or Vue.js.
                    <br>
                    I also aim to learn and become proficient in at least two new languages that are currently in demand, one which is Java.
                    <br> This will not only diversify my skill set but also increase my adaptability in different tracks of software development
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solidify my learning and showcase my abilities, I will focus on developing and deploying personal tech projects. <br>
                    Over the next two years, I intend to complete and launch at least three personal projects that demonstrate a range of skills,
                     <br> from front-end development to back-end services. 
                    These projects will serve as tangible proof of my capabilities and technical proficiency.
                    Building a personal brand is essential for standing out in the tech industry.
                    I plan to create and maintain a personal portfolio website that showcases my projects, skills, and accomplishments. 
                    Additionally, I will grow my online presence on tech forums and social media platforms, contributing to discussions, 
                    sharing insights, and establishing myself as a knowledgeable and active member of the tech community. <br>
                    Over the next two years, I plan to expand my network by connecting with at least 100 new industry professionals
                </p>
                <p>I am committed to pursuing opportunities that align with these values and goals.</p>

                <p>
                    As I embark on the journey to achieve these goals, the HNG Internship presents a unique opportunity to achieve them with a structured system.<br>
                    The internship offers a platform to help my professional development, enhance my skills through hands-on projects,<br> and engage with a vibrant tech community.
